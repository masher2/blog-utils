# Blog Utils

A set of handy commands that I use to manage [my blog](https://masher2.github.io).

I don't really use RStudio IDE so I found easier to make some scripts to automate the creation of posts and the deploy of my blog on the terminal.


# Contents

* `serve-site`: Wrapper around `blogdown::serve_site()`.
* `deploy-site`: Call `blogdown::build_site()`, copy the files in `public/` into the deploy repo, commit and push to remote.


# Workflow

I don't really have one right now, will expand on this when I do.
